  "Facilitates the compilation and debugging of C programs.
In a frame that displays a .c file,
and possibly the *compilation* or *gud-a.out* buffer,
- creates an associated Makefile with the _getfilenames and _mmakefile perl scripts,
unless a Makefile not created by _mmakefile already exists;
- runs make;
- if the compilation is successful, launches gdb,
replaces the *compilation* buffer by the *gud-a.out* buffer,
and leaves point in *gud-a.out* buffer;
- if the compilation is not successful, places point on line of first error
in the buffer that displays the source file.
The point can be either in the window that displays the .c file,
or in the window that displays the *compilation* or *gud-a.out* buffers,
and the .c file will be silently saved.
The .c file F that is displayed might contain pathnames to other source files (that can contain
spaces, can leave out the .c extension, can be relative or absolute but should not start in ~,
and can be preceded or followed by spaces or stars) between a line that contains an
occurrence of 'Other .c source files, if any, one per line, starting on the next line:'
and a line all of whose nonblank characters are stars with a closing comment */ after all
stars, possibly with lines containing nothing but spaces or stars in-between.

the Makefile will be generated in the directory where that file resides."

  "Opens or creates a .c file and prepares compilation, debugging and running.
- Takes a file name as single argument, with either no extension
or with the .c extension.
- If such a file does exist, uses it; otherwise, creates one with the _mctemplate shell script,
prompting the user to reply yes or no to the question whether he or she wants a template
for a one file program rather than for a multifile program. If the answer is no then the template
will include the line 'Other .c source files, if any, one per line, starting on the next line:'
needed for programs that span many files. Answering yes produces a template for a sourcefile meant
to contain the full program.
- Opens the file in a new buffer.
- Creates an associated Makefile with the _mmakefile perl script,
unless a Makefile not created by _mmakefile already exists.
- If the file has been created by _mctemplate, places the point to insert
a short description after 'Description: '.
- If the file has not been created by _mctemplate, runs make.
- If the compilation is successful, launches gdb,
replaces the *compilation* buffer by the *gud-a.out* buffer,
